# HVAC Preconditioning with Machine Learning

This repository contains code and data for predicting heating and cooling times in automotive HVAC systems using machine learning models like LSTM and ESRNN.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains synthetic datasets.
- `models/`: Contains Python scripts for training LSTM and ESRNN models.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing and model training.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the preprocessing : `training_data.py`
3. Train the models: `training_data.py`
